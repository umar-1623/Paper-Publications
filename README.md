# Machine Learning based human recognition via robust Features from audio signals
The aim of this project is to provide data for paper to regenerate the results.
using MFCC file for feature extraction.
PCA is implimented for dimensionality reductions.
Machine learning algorithms are implimented through 'Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis' WEKA.
